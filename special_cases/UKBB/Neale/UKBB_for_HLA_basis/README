Cupcake paper came back with reviews (yay!) asking us to demonstrate why Cupcake won't work properly using HLA.
Olly built a HLA basis and Chris wanted to project UKBB data on this basis to show matches in locations with 
traits in the basis.
For that I'll use the HLA basis manifest, and use the scripts I already wrote for downloading and filtering Neale's files to get those of our 11 traits

Our 11 traits are:

20002_1111 - Asthma
20002_1462 - Crohn's disease
20002_1661 - Vitiligo
20002_1463 - Ulcerative colitis
20002_1464 - Rheumatoid arthritis
20002_1381 - Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
20002_1222 - Type 1 diabetes
